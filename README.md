# stat184-activity15-yeonkyeong

## Overview

This repository is used for STAT 184 Activity 15 (GitHub Practice).  
It stores my work for Activity 14 and shows that I can use GitHub for
version control, including branches, issues, commits, and pull requests.

## Data Sources

All data analyzed in Activity 14 were provided by the STAT 184 data files
through Canvas.  
No additional external data sources were added to this repository.

## Current Plan for the Project

- Keep a copy of the Activity 14 report and the corresponding QMD file.
- Use this repo as an example of good GitHub practices for STAT 184.
- Maintain an up-to-date `main` branch that includes all merged changes
  from development branches.
- Use Issues and Pull Requests to document future changes if the repo is updated.

## Repository Organization

The repository is organized as follows:

- `README.md` – Describes the purpose, contents, and plan for the repo.
- `activity14_report.pdf` – The PDF report that I submitted for Activity 14.
- `activity14.qmd` – The Quarto file used to create the Activity 14 report.
- `.gitattributes` – Git configuration file created automatically by GitHub.
